# ðŸš§ Database

This is not finished yet.

## Assessment
- [x] Choose the database that you want to work with.
- [x] It is recommended that you use an official image for that database instead of building your own.
- [x] Create the Kubernetes resources required to configure and run the database:
  - [x] Kubernetes StatefulSet or Kubernetes Deployment to run the database image
  - [x] Kubernetes ConfigMap to contain any database parameters that are not secret, like database name, user name, port
  - [x] Kubernetes Secret to contain the database password
  - [x] Kubernetes Service to expose the database port so that it can be used by the REST API. What type of Service should you use (ClusterIP, NodePort, Load Balancer, Ingress)?
  - [x] Kubernetes StorageClass, PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim that the database image can use to store the database data
- [x] Think about how to initialize the database with the required schema (if applicable) and data
- [x] Adapt your REST API so that it accesses the database through its service
- [x] Test the REST API with curl and verify that it can both read from and write to the database.

## Information

In this section, we describe the decisions we have made and why. 

### Choosing the database
We choose for a Relational DB Management System (RDBMS). We would like to allow our application to associate timecapsules to specific users in the future. 
An SQL database does provide a clear structure to accomplish this. 
MySQL is Oracle owned and PostgreSQL has a strong ecosystem, supports more datatypes out of the box and is open source.
_"The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects."_ [CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0 ](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/2f97c6e339e67a929651a54370c4cd36385822c3/charter.md).

### Official Image 

Using an official image:
```bash
helm install db-new oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/postgresql --namespace time-capsule -f values.yaml
```

### ðŸš§ Create Kubernetes resources
This creates a StatefulSet and PVC on an externally provisioned volume. We might still want to check if this is working as intended. 
We still have to make this compatible with Secrets and ConfigMaps. 

### Initialize the Database
The database tables (part of schema) are automatically created by FastAPI in _main.py_: `models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`.

### Adapt the REST API so that it accesses the database through its service
The API uses environment variables in _app/config.py_. In the _deployment.yaml_ these environment variables are initialized by using configMaps and Secrets:
```yaml
        <snippet>
        - name: DB_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: db-config
              key: db-name
        - name: DB_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-credentials
              key: db-username
        </snippet>
```

### Test the REST API with curl and verify that it can both read from and write to the database.
It works with curl and within the browser. We demo GETs and POSTs to retrieve and store data respectively.
